# Personality prediction with knn algorithm
 You can open the assignment on Jupyter Notebook
 You don't need to run the assignment from the terminal, just run it is enough. 
 The only thing you need to pay attention to : run it in the same file as the file named 16P.6csv

My department requested a personality prediction program based on the knn algorithm as the last assignment of the fall semester of 2022. The assignment pdf prepared by my teachers is located in the repository with the name PROGRAMMING_ASSIGNMENT_5 (1), you can take a look.

There are about 60 thousand data in the file named 16P.csv, my program gets information about the characteristics of personality types by processing all the "training" data in a short time, then it estimates the personality types of people in the test data by processing the remaining test data.

In this assignment, I learned basic and simple data manipulation methods, I learned at the basic level of the knn algorithm, which is one of the basic algorithms of data science.
